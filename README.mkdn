OpenPdroid for Android 4.1.1 (AOSP)
===============================

**<u>Note</u>**: This is mostly presented for history, as these patches __<u>pre-date</u>__, and __<u>are incompatible</u>__ with Pdroid2.0 and PDroidManager.

These patches were created to work with Svyat's original PDroid application and were ported forward by pastime1971 and mateor. 


Patches
-------------------------------
These are the build patches for AOSP Android 4.1.1 (although they technically work for 4.1.2 as well) There are no complete trees in our repo for these patches as development has moved on to the OpenPdroid expansion.
<ul>
Due to a restriction in the dalvik code, 4.1.x AOSP and most custom roms require different patches. **The general rule for Android 4.1.*, is if the rom already comes with a framework2.jar, then use the ```4.1.2-cm``` patches.** 
</ul>

There are ```apply``` and ```remove``` patch scripts available that I personally use at [my personal github page](https://github.com/mateor/patchScripts). A couple of those scripts also create [auto-patcher](https://www.github.com/mateor/auto-patcher) patches, but the apply/remove scripts could be helpful to anyone reading this.

To Apply
--------------
	cd ~/android/system/build; git checkout -b openpdroid; patch -p1 < ~/openpdroid_4.1.1-aosp_build.patch
    cd ~/android/system/system/core; git checkout -b openpdroid; patch -p1 < ~/openpdroid_4.1.1-aosp_system_core.patch
	cd ~/android/system/libcore; git checkout -b openpdroid; patch -p1 < ~/openpdroid_4.1.1-aosp_libcore.patch
	cd ~/android/system/frameworks/base; git checkout -b openpdroid; patch -p1 < ~/openpdroid_4.1.1-aosp_frameworks_base.patch
	cd ~/android/system; . build/envsetup.sh; brunch <DEVICE_TARGET>


To Remove
--------------
	cd ~/android/system; rm -rf out/target/common/obj/JAVA_LIBRARIES/framework_intermediates out/host/common/obj/JAVA_LIBRARIES/layoutlib_intermediates out/target/common/obj/JAVA_LIBRARIES/services_intermediates

**[OR]** 	cd ~/android; make clobber

**and** to reset your source tree**

	cd ~/android/system/build; git checkout . ; git clean -df
	cd ~/android/system/system/core; git checkout . ; git clean -df
	cd ~/android/system/libcore; git checkout . ; git clean -df
	cd ~/android/system/frameworks/base; git checkout . ; git clean -df
	cd ~/android/system; repo abandon openpdroid

If OpenPDroid intrigues you, yet the thought of applying all these patches gives you
pause, there is a tool that can attempt to patch the framework of an already compiled
rom called [The Auto-Patcher](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=32155918#post32155918). The Auto-patcher still supports these patches, though under the 'pdroid' mod-type.


OpenPDroid is an open source fork of the PDroid framework, as written by Svyat and expanded by CollegeDev. We are always looking for contributors, [come see us on XDA](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2098156) or submit a pull request.
